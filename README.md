# ssl-cert-scripts
A series of scripts and methods used to update SSL Certs on self-hosted services.
I have a number of self-hosted services, and while reverse proxies like nginx are incredibly useful, they can cause issues.
<br>
There are a few services for which I found it was easier to update the cert within the service itself.
<br>
Some are as easy as uploading the new cert via SFTP and restarting a service.
<br>
Others are more involved. These are the scripts I use. You are welcome to use them for any and all purposes.
